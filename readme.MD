# Time Series Prediction with TensorFlow 2.0

I thought it would be fun to build a time series prediction

So I did


**The Data**

the extract script

```
./extract/get_data.sql
```
the data

```
./data/2018.csv
```
[arrived_date] - the date/time the records arrived

[arrived_hour] - the hour of arrival

[arrived_minute] - the minute of the arrival

[record_count] - the record count



**The Goal**

Create a model that can predict the number of records that will be received in the future
